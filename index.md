Hi! I'm Fung YIP, an Econometrician turned Data Scientist with a strong passion of predictive analytics using Algorithmic / Statistical Modelling applied into real-world situations.

I love data blend in with iChing **《易經》**, discovering the nature way harmoniously flowing to ‘Yin’ & ‘Yang’ **《陰陽》**, establishing the Law of Cause and Effect **《因果關係》** and
expressing way of simplicity through Data [0,1] Dao **《易數道》**.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been working using R or Python.

## Econometrics

Econometrics for me is like :heart:"love at first sight". I was first introduced by my classmate at uni that there is a thingy called "Econ" "Metric" when I was doing my Economics degree. My first regression model to build was to predict the price of meat, which is fabulous.

I continued to study Masters in Economics whose syllabus was heavily involved in statistical modelling. This enables me to build a strong foundation on the mathematical side in which I can ride on it to life-learn machine learning.

## Business Intelligence

I fist cut my teeth on Business Intelligence from work - building a set of KPIs to monitor company's performance. This field has evolved a lot both in technology and usage wise. Tools itself which becomes more intelligent are moving towards user-centric with strong emphasis of Data viz.

I feel great that I have opportunities to use both <img class="inline-icon" src="../images/logo/tableau.PNG" width="30" alt="tableau icon" title="Tableau"><span class='salient'>Tableau</span> and <img class="inline-icon" src="../images/logo/qliksense.PNG" width="30" alt="qliksense icon" title="Qliksense"><span class='salient'>Qliksense</span> to apply in cooperate environment, the latter of which includes good ETL capability and now I really fall in love.

## Data Science
Data Scientist is the most sexiest job of the 21st century. That said, I don't feel like I am sexy at all. This field has evolved amazingly fast and I expect this term data science will be replaced by AI or other synonyms terms in the coming years. I use <img class="inline-icon" src="../images/logo/r.png" width="25" alt="r icon" title="R"><span class='salient'>R</span> a lot, making use of tidyverse concept and now increasingly use <img class="inline-icon" src="../images/logo/python.PNG" width="25" alt="python icon" title="Python"><span class='salient'>Python</span> for analyses.

As I am Econometrician turned Data Scientist, I love Time Series forecasting a lot. I 'kaizen' to learn other type of machine learning to add my Data Science arsenal.

## DataiChing
<img class="inline-icon" src="../images/logo/iching.jpg" width="30" alt="iching icon" title="iChing"><span class='salient'>iChing</span>
 is also known as Classic of Changes.  Just like Confucius says,
 >"If Heaven gave me another 50 years to live, I would spend them studying iChing and perhaps then I would beware myself of troubles."

 Confucius wishes he has more time to learn iChing and dedicated himself to it.
 For me same same - Data & iChing will be my **lifetime project** to blend two 2gether.

<!-- ### Digital Analytics

Digital Analytics has gained popularity as O2O took off. When I was in newspaper industry which needs to keep track of users online behavior and consumption. I 'kaizen' to learn how to track an app usage, attempting to understand the whole online ecosystem. Google Analytics is the main tool I use for digital  for tracking analyses
