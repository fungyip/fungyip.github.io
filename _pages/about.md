## About
Hi! I'm Fung YIP, an Econometrician turned Data Scientist with a strong passion of predictive analytics using Algorithmic / Statistical Modelling applied into real-world situations.

I also love data blend in with iChing **《易經》**, discovering the nature way harmoniously flowing to ‘Yin’ & ‘Yang’ **《陰陽》**, establishing the Law of Cause and Effect **《因果關係》** and
expressing way of simplicity through Data [0,1] Dao **《易數道》**.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been working using R or Python.


## Data Science
I used R![R](/images/logo/r.png)

$$X_i$$

$$X_{i}$$

$$X^2_{i,j}$$


\[\begin{bmatrix}
1&0&0\\
0&1&0\\
0&0&1\\
\end{bmatrix}\]
