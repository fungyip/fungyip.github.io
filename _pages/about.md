## About
Hi! I'm Fung YIP, an Econometrician turned Data Scientist with a strong passion of predictive analytics using Algorithmic / Statistical Modelling applied into real-world situations.

I also love data blend in with iChing 易經, discovering the nature way harmoniously flowing to ‘Yin’ & ‘Yang’ 陰陽, establishing the Law of Cause and Effect 因果關係 and
expressing way of simplicity through Data [0,1] Dao 易數道.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been working using R or Python.
